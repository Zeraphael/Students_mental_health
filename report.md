Student Mental Health SQL Analysis Report

Overview

This project analyzes the mental health status of university students using SQL. The dataset includes self-reported data on mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, panic attacks), demographic details (age, gender, marital status), academic data (course, CGPA, year of study), and whether students sought professional help.

The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and correlations that can help educational institutions better understand and support student mental well-being.



Key Questions Explored

How many students are affected by mental health conditions?

Are there patterns based on gender, age, or year of study?

Do students with higher CGPAs report fewer mental health issues?

How many students actually seek help?

Which mental health issues frequently occur together?



Summary of Findings

1. Prevalence of Mental Health Issues

A large number of students reported at least one mental health issue (depression, anxiety, or panic attacks).

A subset of students reported experiencing all three major issues simultaneously.


2. Help-Seeking Behavior

A significant number of students with mental health issues did not seek help from specialists.

Female students were more likely to seek help compared to male students.


3. Gender Trends

Both genders reported mental health issues, but females had a slightly higher reported rate.

Males were less likely to seek professional help, even when facing serious symptoms.


4. Age-Based Analysis

Mental health issues were observed across all age groups, with a spike around age 18, typically the start of university life.

Younger students appear to be more vulnerable, possibly due to transition stress.


5. Course and CGPA Correlation

Certain academic programs had higher rates of mental health issues.

CGPA had mixed correlation — some high-performing students still experienced anxiety and panic attacks.

Students with both high and low CGPAs reported issues, suggesting that academic performance is not the only factor.


6. Year of Study

Mental health challenges appeared across all academic years.

Early-year students reported higher rates of anxiety and depression, possibly due to adjustment stress.


7. Issue Combinations

Anxiety and Depression were the most common combination.

Many students experienced overlapping symptoms but did not seek help.


8. Monthly Trends

By analyzing date fields, we observed variation across months — some spikes might relate to exam periods or academic deadlines.





Insights & Recommendations

Awareness programs should target first-year students and 18-year-olds, who show high vulnerability.

Universities should invest in accessible mental health services and promote them actively.

Encourage male students to open up and seek help without stigma.

More research is needed to understand course-specific stressors and provide targeted support.

Monitor mental health trends throughout the academic year, especially around exam seasons.





Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to explore mental health data, find patterns, and inform potential interventions. By combining data analysis with meaningful questions, we can turn raw data into actionable insights that benefit real people.
