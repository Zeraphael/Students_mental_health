# Mental Health Analysis of University Students

This project uses structured query language (SQL) to explore the mental health status of university students based on gender, age, course, year of study, CGPA, and other attributes.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymous responses from students regarding:
- Mental health conditions (Depression, Anxiety, Panic Attacks)
- Whether they sought help from a specialist
- Their academic and demographic details (Age, CGPA, Gender, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQL (SQLite)
- Python (for optional visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for optional charts)
- [Tool used for querying — e.g., DB Browser for SQLite, MySQL, etc.]

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

- How many students are facing mental health issues?
- What percentage of students seek professional help?
- Is there a gender-based or age-based trend in mental health?
- Do CGPA and course correlate with mental health status?
- What combinations of mental health issues are most common?

## 📈 Optional Visualizations (if using Python)
- Trend of mental health issues over time
- Most vulnerable age groups
- Gender distribution of help-seeking behavior

## 💡 Insights

- Students in early academic years showed higher levels of mental distress.
- A significant portion of students do not seek help, despite mental health issues.
- Female students are more likely to report and seek help than males.
- Certain courses had higher reported mental health concerns.
